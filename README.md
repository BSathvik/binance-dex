Binance Decentralized Exchange
----------------
We are submitting this project as a part of the [Binance DEXathon](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/binance-dexathon-845dc0cbfffe),
a coding competition held by Binance with the goal of building a Decentralized exchange. Our implementation of a
decentralized exchange is built off of Bitcoin, with many major changes to certain inner workings of bitcoin that
improve its scalability.

We removed Proof-of-Work and replaced it with a new implementation of Delegated Proof-of-Stake, a consensus algorithm
that involves voting in block producers, who are selected to produce blocks on a schedule, in order to maintain a
consistent blocktime while being able to handle many more transactions per second than most other consensus mechanisms.
We will explain the tradeoffs of using this type of consensus in the "Design Rationale" section below.

After implementing Delegated Proof-of-Stake, the main challenge of this project, we implemented the required market
functions easily by creating new fields in transactions as well as new transaction types. In our case, market order
transactions, asset transactions, asset creation, and native coin transactions are each different transaction types. We
also added transaction attributes, allowing us to easily add the required information for each new transaction type.
These attributes, as well as the way that we have separated the transaction types, make it very easy to add market
features that are related to any type of value exchange, without using or needing any Ethereum or NEO-style smart
contracts. Everything is baked directly into the blockchain.

For this reason, we can run an off-chain matching engine alongside a full node that is able to execute an atomic trade
event.

Design Rationale
----------------
For this project we made multiple design decisions in order to improve the performance of the exchange. Our main goal
was to have as much throughput as possible, since liquidity is a necessity in any type of exchange.

There are pretty much two factors that effect throughput and exchange performance for decentralized exchanges specifically:
 - Consensus algorithm chosen (BIG factor, difficult to get right)
 - Off Chain vs On Chain matching engine
 
When we approached this massive project we knew that for people to use a decentralized exchange, it had to be extremely
fast. This was the basis of our design rationale.

### Consensus

We researched various consensus algorithms to try to find the fastest one. Here is a summary of our findings:

#### Proof-of-Work (PoW)
Had we chosen this consensus mechanism, we would have created the slowest decentralized exchange in existence. This is
the main drawback of Proof-of-Work (bitcoin's consensus mechanism), low throughput in exchange for high security and
potentially high decentralization. This was not optimal for a decentralized exchange. While it was already implemented
in the bitcoin repo, we ended up completely removing Proof-of-Work from bitcoin, which was less trivial than it sounds.

#### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
Proof-of-Stake is, in theory, much faster than Proof-of-Work and is in general very fast. However, there are currently
no implementations of Proof-of-Stake that correctly address the Nothing at Stake Problem well. [Casper FFG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437),
the consensus algorithm proposed by Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith, addresses many of the problems with naive Proof-of-Stake
, including the Nothing at Stake problem but is very complicated and there are currently no working implementations. We
decided that if the Casper Authors could not implement Casper on the platform they invented and wrote in almost a year,
there was no way we could implement it in the Bitcoin repo in a couple months.

#### Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)
Delegated Proof-of-Stake is the consensus algorithm of EOS, Bitshares, and Steem, and uses a weighted voting-based consensus
algorithm. Nodes vote on "witnesses", such that the number of votes they are able to give is equal to their balance. The
N witnesses with the most votes are then scheduled into time slots to produce blocks. This typeof consensus is very fast
(thousands of transactions per second) but it does have some essential drawbacks, most notably:
 - It is "distributed," not completely decentralized in nature
 - Fails in a similar way to Proof-of-Stake, where block producers can collude with large stakeholders as well as other block
 producers, meaning there is no penalty for being malicious and creating an oligopolistic network. This is not addressed
 by any DPoS implementation currently. This is a problem where there are "No repercussions" to being a malicious block producer.

We then realized that there is no formal definition or specification for DPoS. There are currently two implementations
of the protocol. One implementation is Lisk, the other is Dan Larimer's implementation (BitShares/Steem/EOS), which has
not changed for a very long time. While this is inconvenient, DPoS boasts large throughput with *relatively* low complexity,
so we chose to implement this consensus mechanism. This proved to be a challenge as there is currently no DPoS implementation
that uses an UTXO-based accounting model.

We considered using a graph-based structure with DPoS, such as Nano, but realized there is no clear incentive to run a node
and therefore no transaction fees.

#### Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT)
Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance works in a way similar to DPoS, with a few key differences. dBFT is currently used only
by the NEO platform, which we had some experience with at the start of this project. dBFT works by allowing nodes to enroll
as Delegates for a fixed fee. Nodes then vote (with stake, like DPoS) on these delegates to be a "bookkeeper" node. Out of these bookkeeper, a node
is randomly chosen to be a speaker, or to build the block that 66% of the other bookkeepers reach consensus on. This is
also extremely fast, and NEO currently operates with 0 transaction fees. However, when we looked through the NEO source code
we found a problem:
 - We found no way to send vote transactions in the source code.
 - There are default, hard-coded bookkeeping nodes in NEO, and >51% of the stake is owned by the NEO council, meaning that
 the network is "owned" by the NEO council.
 
These issues led to us not using NEO or dBFT, as we couldn't rely on the consensus algorithm being secure on a large network
with public voting.

#### Conclusion on consensus:
We chose DPoS because it is simple, fast, and we had found solutions to the major consensus and governance issues that current
implementations have.

### Order Matching

Order matching is rarely a bottleneck for decentralized exchanges, since the consensus algorithm for distributed ledgers
is what leads to low transaction throughput and high latency. This is why we put so much work into the consensus algorithm,
the more a team knows their consensus algorithm and both its technical and cryptoeconomic benefits / drawbacks, the more
secure and decentralized the network will be. The throughput is determined by the choice of consensus algorithm, so we chose
the one that was proven to be the fastest and had the potential to be the most secure, which was DPoS.

The matching engine,
at this point, was not the bottleneck anymore. We used an existing open-source matching engine, [LightMatchingEngine](https://github.com/gavincyi/LightMatchingEngine), that could obtain transactions
through ZMQ (a subscription/notification system), construct the order book, and match orders faster than they can be placed
on the blockchain.

### UTXOs vs Account-Based

Some blockchains, such as bitcoin, use Unspent Transaction Outputs to keep track of whether or not a user can spend a certain
amount of coins. This allows for bitcoin's many-to-many model and allows for much more scalability versus an account-based model.
It would have been very difficult to implement an account-based model and would not have yielded many more benefits.

We used the [Ethereum Design Rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale) as a resource for this decision.

### Choice of the bitcoin repo and changes made

We chose the bitcoin repo because, aside from Proof-of-Work, it is an extremely robust, secure, and very scalable cryptocurrency.
We had some challenges when implementing multiple assets and premine, but for the most part it "just worked". When we were deciding how to start,
were not aware that MIT DCI had the [CryptoKernel](https://github.com/mit-dci/CryptoKernel), which is an extremely interesting innovation.

Improvements, challenges, what the ideal DEX looks like, and how to make it.
---------------

We had many challenges, learned a lot, and were able to come up with solutions to many of the unsolved problems regarding
robust and scalable cryptocurrencies, decentralized exchanges, and adoption. We were also able to reason about what were
the **wrong** ways to build a decentralized exchange, and what it would take to build the best, most adaptive decentralized
exchange.

### Challenges and Innovations

Removing Proof-of-Work and adding in a new consensus algorithm was considerably difficult. When we started out, we talked to [Gavin Andresen](https://www.cics.umass.edu/ventures)
in person about the challenges we were going to face when working with the Bitcoin repo. He gave valuable advice but warned about the difficulty of the project. One of those
difficulties was dealing with UTXOs. Creating new types of transactions, such as VOTE and ENROLL, that were able to indicate certain DPoS specific actions, were easy to implement
but hard to add functionality to. We were stuck on how to count votes and ensure a correct DPoS implementation while still using UTXOs. We devised an algorithm to search through
blocks as they come in and securely verify certain things about the network, such as balances, vote count, and addresses / nodes voted for. We iterate through transactions and
use persistent storage, as well as network processing, to distribute this information and verify consistency across the network.

Since every feature needed to be directly on the blockchain, we had to get extremely comfortable with the repository and the fundamentals behind cryptocurrencies, blockchain,
decentralized exchanges, and consensus. Because of this, we were able to come up with solutions to unsolved problems, as well as come up with new problems in the cryptocurrency space.
The main downside that we saw with our program is the consensus, surprisingly. It comes with the same drawbacks that current implementations do, although we have come up with
solutions to the drawbacks of DPoS:
 - The "No repercussions" problem and collusion problem can be solved by actually requiring witnesses to stake a certain amount, as well as providing a bounty for a proof that a
 witness was malicious.
 - Instead of scheduling witnesses, randomly selecting their order somehow, like using an extremely easy proof-of-work for witnesses to generate blocks, would prevent DDoS attacks on
 specific scheduled witnesses. This would prevent sabotage, since it is in a witnesses' best interest to sabotage / disconnect the other witness nodes so they get voted out for not
 producing blocks.
 - Draw inspiration from Casper FFG to solve problems with malicious actors without compromising on scalability or speed.

These have not been implemented in any DPoS implementation and would greatly improve the decentralization and security of the network.
 
We were also by the challenge of creating atomic trades that are also decentralized. Without "smart contracts," this problem arises but is not unsolvable. Using balances as inputs
to an order transaction, and allowing order transactions to be provided as inputs to a multi-signature "match" transaction could potentially allow for many-to-many order matching,
allowing the matching engine to do the work of finding / matching trades, without necessarily requiring a matcher or witness to facilitate the trade. This is something that is not
trivial to implement but possible.

### What the ideal DEX looks like and how to make it:

The ideal DEX is one where the users / nodes have control over their funds and trades, which is fast, secure, and easy to use.

Implementations of decentralized exchanges which rely on non-mathematically provable operations are not secure. Bitcoin does a great job at using a process to correctly validate
transactions, even if they include additional information, without using smart contracts or a balance-based accounting model. UTXOs increase the complexity of the problems that need
to be solved but do not provide any detriment to efficiency or security. If we were building the ideal decentralized exchange we would use UTXOs. It would take longer to develop
because it would be more complex, but it would be well worth the extra time spent in robustness and security. We would also make our proposed changes to delegated proof of stake and improve on the patchy current implementations of DPoS, such as Steem, EOS, and Lisk.

Off-chain matching engines are the best solution to the problem of order matching as long as they are provably fair, and this is not difficult to implement as many provably fair
matching algorithms use simple data structures such as queues to accomplish this task. These algorithms are very fast and would not bottleneck the number of trades executed
on the network.

Instead of using Bitcoin or any other existing cryptocurrency source, we learned that it would have been a better DEX implementation if we had started from scratch given the
competition's time constraint. We originally thought we would not have been able to deliver it on time. One interesting development that would have been very useful is the
[CryptoKernel](https://github.com/mit-dci/CryptoKernel), developed by the MIT DCI, which is essentially a barebones framework for creating a blockchain or cryptocurrency. This would have allowed us to more easily implement everything required for a decentralized exchange, as well as allowed us to create additional functionality on top of that.

Overall, we learned a lot about cryptocurrencies, decentralized exchanges, and consensus algorithms, and we would like to continue development using this knowledge. We would be
extremely interested in continuing this development based on the ideas we've discussed at Binance, and would like to know about any opportunities to work at Binance next summer for
internships.

What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoin.org/en/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).
