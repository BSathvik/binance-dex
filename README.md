Binance Decentralized Exchange
----------------
We are submitting this project as a part of the [Binance DEXathon](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/binance-dexathon-845dc0cbfffe), a coding competition held by Binance with the goal of building a Decentralized exchange. Our implementation of a decentralized exchange is built off of Bitcoin, with many major changes to certain inner workings of bitcoin that improve its scalability. 

We removed Proof-of-Work and replaced it with a new implementation of Delegated Proof-of-Stake, a consensus algorithm that involves voting in block producers, who are selected to produce blocks on a schedule, in order to maintain a consistent blocktime while being able to handle many more transactions per second than most other consensus mechanisms. We will explain the tradeoffs of using this type of consensus in the "Design Rationale" section below. 

After implementing Delegated Proof-of-Stake, the main challenge of this project, we implemented the required market functions easily by creating new fields in transactions as well as new transaction types. In our case, market order transactions, asset transactions, asset creation, and native coin transactions are each different transaction types. We also added transaction attributes, allowing us to easily add the required information for each new transaction type. These attributes, as well as the way that we have separated the transaction types, make it very easy to add market features that are related to any type of value exchange, without using or needing any Ethereum or NEO-style smart contracts. Everything is baked directly into the blockchain.

For this reason, we can run an off-chain matching engine within a full node that is able to execute an atomic trade event. 

Running a node using Docker
----------------
The Dockerfile builds an image with all the dependencies installed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
Note: The Image doesn't have the binance-dex repo, you'll have to git clone it. Also, don't use `sudo` in the container.

1. Install Docker
2. Build the image by running `docker build -t binance-dex:first .`
3. To run image. `docker run -it -v <volume_name>:/home/ binance-dex:first`
4. Now, `git clone "https://github.com/BSathvik/binance-dex"`
5. Compile the repo

What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoin.org/en/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).
